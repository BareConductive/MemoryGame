# Bare Conductive Memory Game

[Processing](http://www.processing.org/download) sketch that creates a memory game that can be played with key inputs. Developed to be used with the [Touch Board] (http://www.bareconductive.com/shop/touch-board/)

## Requirements

* [Processing](http://www.processing.org/download) 3.0+ with Sound installed

## Install

1. Close the Processing IDE if you have it open.
1. Download the [.zip](https://github.com/BareConductive/MemoryGame/archive/public.zip) or clone the repository to your local machine - if downloading the .zip, extract the contents somewhere that suits you.
1. Take the **MemoryGame** folder and move it to **Processing Sketchbook Folder**. This will be different for each operating system:

	or
	
	My Documents\\Processing	
	
	**Mac**
	
	Documents/Processing

	If this folder does not exist, create it first.
1. Reopen the Processing IDE - you should now be able to open the sketch in the **File -> Sketchbook** menu.
